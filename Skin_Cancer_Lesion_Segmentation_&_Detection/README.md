# Skin lesion detection from dermoscopic images using Convolutional Neural Networks


## Abstract 

The recent emergence of machine learning and deep learning methods for medical image analysis has enabled the development 
of intelligent medical imaging-based diagnosis systems that can assist physicians in making better decisions about a 
patientâ€™s health. In particular, skin imaging is a field where these new methods can be applied with a high rate of success.

#### "Fine-Tuned Smart" Solution Approach Abstraction:-->
"Fine-tuned Smart Solution approach" focuses on solving the problem of automatic skin lesion detection, particularly on melanoma detection, by "
**semantic segmentation** and followed by  **classification (powered by Transfer Learning)**" from **dermoscopic images (from ISIC)** using a deep learning based approach. 
 - For the 1st part of the solution approach (semantic segmentation for an **accurate extraction of the lesion region**) -
  ** U-Net convolutional neural network architecture** is applied. 
 - For the 2nd part of the solution approach (Classification /binary classification of **"Benign versus Malignant Cancer"** for early melanoma detection) - 
     - The proposed solution is built around the **VGG-Net ConvNet architecture** and 
	 - uses the **Transfer learning paradigm** (to deal with the general challenge of**Minimal Ground Truth** by avoid groud up training of Detection Model.).

**P.S.** 
	- This solution approach performs way better, optimized and offers better result. The experimental results of the segmentation evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method can outperform other state-of-the-art models.
	- It very effectively deals with the general challenge of **Minimal Ground Truth** (i.e., challenge of **lack of large amount of labelled dataset**) by avoid groud up training of Detection Model.
	- The model is general enough to be extended to **multi-class** skin lesion classification.

#### "Classical" Solution Approach Abstraction:-->
 - "Classical Solution approach" focuses on solving the problem of automatic skin lesion detection by straightway subjecting the entire image to **classification alone** model.

####"The Comparative View" of Smart Vis-a-Vis Classical Solution Approaches:-->
 - "ROC Curve" is drawn as well for a comparative evaluation of classification alone (using the entire image) against a 
combination of the two approaches (segmentation followed by classification) in order to assess which of them achieves
 better classification results.
 - Experimental results are encouraging: on the ISIC Archive dataset, the Smart Solution approach achieves a **sensitivity** value of **78.66%**, which is significantly higher than the many of the state of the art (SOTA Models) on that dataset.
